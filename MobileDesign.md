| Extra Large | ≤ 1600px | Large Desktops |
| Large | ≤ 1400px | Medium Desktops |
| Medium | ≤ 1200px | Small Desktops |
| Small | ≤ 992px | Tablets (Landscape) |
| Extra Small | ≤ 768px | Tablets (Portrait) & Large Phones |
| Mobile | ≤ 576px | Mobile Phones |

## Mobile-Specific UI Changes

### Navigation
- Mobile navigation collapses into a hamburger menu
- Navbar dropdown expands to full width when opened
- Nav dropdown has a fixed position with scrollable content

  - Semi-transparent white background (70% opacity)
  - Subtle blur effect for depth
  - Positioned at 10% from top with subtle shadow
  - Improved readability with text shadow
- Reduced main heading font size (2rem on mobile vs 4.9rem on desktop)
- Adjusted header image height (400px on mobile vs 811px on desktop)
- "Let's Talk" button repositioned from navbar to services menu on small screens
- Set header-image margin-bottom to 0 for tighter mobile layout
- Set header-main-carousel margin-bottom to 0 !important to eliminate bottom spacing

### UI Elements
